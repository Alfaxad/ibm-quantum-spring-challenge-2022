# IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022(SOLUTIONS)

## Introduction


 
When Richard Feynman proposed quantum computing 41 years ago, he imagined devices which could be used to model the quantum world around us. This year's IBM Quantum Spring Challenge focuses exactly on Professor Feynman's vision, simulating chemistry and many-body systems with four inviting challenges to solve.

The IBM Quantum Spring Challenge took place from **Monday, May 23 at 9AM EDT to Friday, May 27 at 5PM EDT**, and was be divided into two segments. One part  invited participants to tackle problems revolving around many-body systems, while the other focused on fermionic chemistry simulations. Participants will get a one-of-a-kind opportunity to investigate problems at the forefront of quantum computing research.

I am providing my lab solutions(100% solved) so that anyone who wants to start out with quantum computing can easily get along. For further knowledge about Quantum computing, I recommend  the **qiskit textbook(beta) : https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta** I also recommend the following **lecture series in quantum computing : https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/**. And finally, I recommend  a **youtube series with hands on coding : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY**
